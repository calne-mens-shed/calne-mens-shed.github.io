            <h1>Our Shed</h1>
			<p>Our Shed (The Calne Men's Shed) originated with a process started back in November 2016, when Jane Vaughan, Community Engagement Manager for Calne got together a small group of like minded people to see if the concept would work in our town, was there even a need for it?</p>
			<p>It very quickly transpired that not only was the need there, but also the people willing to get it to work.</p>
			<p>There followed a series of meetings to get a workable strategy in place, culminating with a public meeting held in the Hub, to try and gauge if you, the future members, wanted a "Shed" in Calne.</p>
			<p>It became quite clear that there was a desire for such an organisation and with many of you signing up for membership, then and there. We were up, if not quite running.</p>
			<p>Like most good ideas, you get started and then you get either lucky, or unlucky, we got very lucky. We were offered an opportunity to share premises with The Repair Academy, by The Wiltshire Wildlife Trust, who leased the premises from Hills Waste Solutions. All three of these organisations were very helpful in getting us started.</p>
			<p>Things move on however and the owners of the building in which we were located needed to repossess the building in order to redevelop it, this meant we had to vacate our premises by the end of this February (2020).</p>
			<p>Fortunately for us, some space became available in an old shop located in the centre of Calne in Church Street. Although it is initially only secure for six months, the shop now known as Calne Central is on a rolling lease giving us at least three months' notice should we have to vacate.</p>
			<p>Because of our new location we are hoping to open six days a week â€“ Monday through to Saturday. We will post our opening hours once we are fully set up.</p>
